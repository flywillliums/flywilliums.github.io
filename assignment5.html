          <h2>Challenge 5: Accessibility Concerns</h2>
          <p>Accessibility for users of the web is of huge importance. Visually impaired people usual use screen readers or magnification/zoom for recognizing text. In particular in this assignment, the forms section can be of issue for Accessibility. Every form must contain correct labels and instructions so that screen readers can convey to the user what their use case is. Then there is the case when a form is filled incorrectly, the screen reader has to have the info to explain what was wrong. Commonly the text is just highlighted red to convey something is wrong in a form.</p>
